=== Notes ===
    Firestore Layout:
        The way firestore is set up, each collection has documents with an associated unique hash ID string.
        I include Id's in the fields section, but think of them as implicit fields.
        However, when an Id is a field in another collection, that represents a subcollection relationship.

        Think of the collection as the tree (or a table) and the document as a node (or a row entry).
        Each document has Fields (attributes)
            If a document is a row entry, these are the column entries.
            Each Field has two things:
                1) Type, which is one of the following:
                    string
                    number
                    boolean
                    map
                    array
                    null
                    timestamp
                    geopoint
                    reference
                2) Value
        
        Visual Representation is as follows...
            Collection
                Document#1
                    Field#1
                        Type
                        Value
                    Field#2
                        Type
                        Value
                    (Sub)Collection
                        Field#1
                            Type
                            Value
                Document#2
                    Field#1
                        Type
                        Value
                    Field#2
                        Type
                        Value
    


=== Collections ===

    "users"
        Description: Each document is a unique user

        Fields:
            (usersId)

            userName
                Type: string
            email
                Type: string (use some sort of requirement IN CODE for @ and .com format)
            dateJoined
                Type: timestamp
            followingList
                Type: array of strings (name of other user)

                             References have a path to a document, so here it would be pointing to /reviews/<reviewsId>

                Fields:
                    (userReviewsId)

                    revRef

=== Notes ===
    Firestore Layout:
        The way firestore is set up, each Collection has Documents with an associated unique hash ID string.
        I include Id's in the Fields section, but think of them as implicit Fields.
        You can also have (Sub)Collections inside Documents, which allows for data nesting. These (Sub)Collections then have their own Documents.

        Think of the Collection as the tree (or a table) and the Document as a node (or a row entry).

        Each Document has Fields (attributes)
            If a Document is a row entry, these are the column entries.
            Each Field has two things:
                1) Type, which is one of the following:
                    string
                    number
                    boolean
                    map
                    array
                    null
                    timestamp
                    geopoint
                    reference
                2) Value
        
        Visual Representation is as follows...
            Top Level Collection
                Document#1
                    Field#1
                        Type
                        Value
                    Field#2
                        Type
                        Value
                    (Sub)Collection#1
                        Document#1 (this is different than the Document#1 above)
                            Field#1
                                Type
                                Value
                Document#2
                    Field#1
                        Type
                        Value
                    Field#2
                        Type
                        Value
    

    More on the "albums" Collection:
        So each album Document has a URL to its album cover in the Field "coverUrl"
        I think the images are hosted on AudioDB, and if an API key is needed to access them use the following...
            API key: 523532

        There are currently 2837 "albums" in the firestore database (as of 3/2/2024). 
        I say "albums" because some of them are technically not studio albums, but instead are greatest hits compilations, EPs, single releases, etc.
        These albums come from the following 98 artists...
            The Beatles
            Steely Dan
            Pink Floyd
            Coldplay

Hi! Allow me to walk you through how to connect our Firebase project and the Firestore database within it 
to your code script...

For Python:

    Initial Step:
        You will need to install firebase-admin if you have not already by running the following command in the terminal:
            
            pip3 install --upgrade firebase-admin

        Note: my computer uses pip3, yours may use pip



    What to do in your code:
        You can literally copy and paste the following imports and variable setups:

            import firebase_admin
            from firebase_admin import credentials
            from firebase_admin import firestore

            cred = credentials.Certificate("/Users/johnreinker/Desktop/admin_key.json")
            firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)

            # Initialize Firestore
            db = firestore.client()

    Note: you will have to change the path that is the arguement of credentials.Certificate().
    The example I provided is when the .json file names "admin_key" is on my Mac's Desktop.
    This .json contains the server credetials of our firebase project.


For React:

    Initial Step:
        You will need to install firebase with the following terminal command:

            npm install firebase

    What to do in your code:   
        Note: The process here is a bit different than Python. In the greater React project 
        (most likely in the src directory), you should make a file called something like firebase.js
        In the tutorial, he actually created a new directory in src first, named it "config" and then
        put the firebase.js file in config.

        Note#2: In the tutoril, he stored the actual credential information in a .env (literally just called .env) 
        file that he created in the greater project directory. He then had the firebase.js file read those values
        from the .env file.
        This is done for security reasons, as then the .env file can be put in .gitignore so its not shared with
        or edited by people who get the repository


        Ok so this is what to put in the firebase.js file:
        
            import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
            import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

            // the credentials
            const firebaseConfig = {
            apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,
            authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,
            projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
            storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,
            messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
            appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID
            };

            // Initialize Firebase
            const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

            // Initialize Firestore
            export const db = getFirestore(app);
        
        And here is what to put in the .env file:

            REACT_APP_API_KEY=AIzaSyCiyy-nWml1Mq7IpY-R_coieikUBRnTc3g
            REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=backboxd.firebaseapp.com
            REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=backboxd
            REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=backboxd.appspot.com
            REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=162903043809
            REACT_APP_APP_ID=1:162903043809:web:e9dab4fc7c6155aa9611a0
